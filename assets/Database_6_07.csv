Modern construction was used to renovate the building and to enable natural light and ventilation through skylights on the ceiling and large windows that also open up views to the garden and site itself. Meanwhile, the profile of the floating canopy roof was constructed based on the original pitched roof of the hospital building, hence showing the attempt to preserve what was on the site as much as possible. Other elements, including tiling, flooring, and window frames were also kept. Such an inclusive design represents the diversity of the community in Marrickville."""

Hebel and Felix Heisel is one of the units at the NEST research building on the campus of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) in Dübendorf, Switzerland. The building design demonstrates how a responsible approach to dealing with our natural resources can go hand in hand with appealing architectural form. The project is underpinned by the proposition that all the resources required to construct a building must be fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable. This places life-cycle thinking at the forefront of the design: instead of merely using and subsequently disposing of resources, they are borrowed from their technical and biological cycles for a certain amount of time before being put back into circulation once again. This conceptual emphasis means that UMAR functions simultaneously as a material laboratory and as a temporary material storage."""

The new student accommodation consists of two parts - the Garden Building and the Villa Building - that aim to enhance the well-being of the residents on campus. One key challenge to the project was integrating the pre-existing buildings, while taking into account the West Cambridge Conservation Area located near to the site. The resulting villa has a scale similar to that of its neighbours, while the materiality is also quite similar (red brick walls, tiled roofs, and white window frames). Cross laminated timber was used to reduce the impact of embodied carbon and to speed up the construction process. Furthermore, the architects put an emphasis on the ""opportunity to create new, energy efficient buildings"" that could join the community. Overall, very low heating requirements were achieved through the Passivhaus system where heating is provided by electric heaters to minimise energy loss from distributing the heat."""

The entry to the house was reconstructed so that the residents can enter from streetlevel, and people are led directly to the garden space. The installation of glazing, skylights, and an insulated envelope both enhanced the performance of the building and established connections to the garden. Lighting on the garden was also emphasised so that the house almost feels disconnected from the dense, urban context of the city."""

Whil the building's inner spatial organisation follows a Euclidean system of stacked cubes, the external envelope is to be understood as a living organism. In order to harvest the smog, the facade's metal mesh attracts dust particles from the surrounding air through an electrostatic mechanism. This apparatus glues the small waste elements together forming a hairy fur that in its final stage would carpet the entire building structure. This procedure repeats itself whenever the seasonal monsoon rain washes down the particles after which they can be collected and recycled. The building envelope acts as a catalyst between the highly controlled environment of the art gallery and the sometimes hazardous outside conditions. It filters the smog waste particles, turns them into building materials for a limited time and then releases them to be collected and treated. In this way the building changes its appearance in accordance to natural as well as man made climatic and environment conditions. "
