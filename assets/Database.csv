One key aspect of the site - high wind pressure - heavily informed the design of the project, placing it under the Site category. The optimum shape that can withstand high wind is a circle, hence making the Bioclimatic Dwelling circular. This led to the optimum arrangement of spaces and usage of local materials.Furthermore, 2 Warka towers that are located in the community collect 40 to 80 litres of water daily from the air, enabling the community to be self-sufficient.

The base of the blades has been used as four towers, each with their own character. The cut off parts are spread around the garden and connect the towers. Between the towers a net provides an opportunity for climbing and is also preventing balls ending up in the backyards around the playground.Besides the rotor blades there is more that has been reused, for example the stainless steel slides and the tiles of the pavement.

Despite the difficulties regarding the adherence to the National Park Service's guidelines due to the site's historical significance, Neumann Monson Architects was successful in creating an efficient building. For instance, historical preservation guidelines require the maintenance of single-pane windows that hinder insulation, while the pre-existing brick facade is useless during extreme weathers. The fact that the project comes under the Site and Reuse categories can be observed through how more than 97.7% of the building's original materials were reused throughout construction. Such repurposing of materials both reduced the amount of waste generated while maintaining the historical aspects of the site.
